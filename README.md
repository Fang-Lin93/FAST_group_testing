# FAST: An Adaptive Group Testing Strategy


This repository contains examples and simulation set-up for our paper 'FAST: An Adaptive Group Testing Strategy
for COVID-19 by FANG Linjiajie, JING Bingyi, Ling Shen, YANG Qing'.

- [Simluation](simulation): Generate simulation data.
- [Grouptesting](grouptesting): A convenient module to create custom group testing strategies, our FAST strategy 
is also constructed in this way.
- [Utilities](utils):  Utilities to support our common tasks, including evaluation of FNR and FPR, and some plots.


For a more detailed overview of the repository, please see the paper at the...(undergoing...)


See [example](example.ipynb) for examples of using our program
[simulations](simulation_example_betas.py) is an example of generating simulation results of our paper.
