# FAST: An Adaptive Group Testing Strategy


This repository contains examples and simulation set-up for our [paper](pending)  by FANG Linjiajie, JING Bingyi, Ling Shen, YANG Qing'.

- [Simluation](simulation): Generate simulation data.
- [Grouptesting](grouptesting): A convenient module to create custom group testing strategies, our FAST strategy 
is also constructed in this way.
- [Utilities](utils):  Utilities to support our common tasks, including evaluation of FNR and FPR, and some plots.
- [GUI](gui.py): a simple program for simulation results

For a more detailed overview of the repository, please see the paper at the...(undergoing...)


See [Example](example.ipynb) for examples of using our program

File [Simulation](sim.py) is an example of generating simulation results in our paper.
